## Architecture

In this full-stack project, I worked with several frontend technologies that each offered different approaches to web development. Express HTML represents a traditional server-side rendering approach where HTML pages are generated on the server and sent complete to the client. This method is straightforward but requires page reloads for any new content. The Angular SPA represents a more modern architecture where an application loads once and then dynamically rewrites the current page as users interact, instead of loading entirely new pages. The backend used MongoDB as its NoSQL database for several strategic reasons. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB's document-oriented structure allows for flexible, schema-less data storage that could evolve as application requirements change. Additionally, the JSON-like document format eliminates the object-relational mapping complexities that arise with SQL databases. The horizontal scalability of MongoDB also provides a future-proof solution for handling potential growth in data volume and user traffic.

## Functionality

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) differs from JavaScript in that it's a data format rather than a programming language. While JavaScript provides programming logic and functionality, JSON offers a lightweight way to represent data. JSON serves as the crucial bridge between the frontend and backend in a full-stack application by providing a standardized format for data exchange. When the frontend requests data, the backend retrieves information from the database, formats it as JSON, and sends it to the client, where JavaScript can parse and use it within the application.

Throughout development, I refactored code multiple times to improve functionality and efficiency. One significant instance involved extracting repetitive parts of HTML, using templating strategies to create reusable templates, and injecting them straight into the HTML. In another instance, I created reusable components in Angular that were applied similarly. The benefits of reusable UI components became evident as the project grew in complexity. They not only reduced development time but also ensured consistency across the application. 

## Testing

Understanding methods, endpoints, and security is fundamental to full-stack application testing. Methods refer to HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that define the actions performed on resources. Each endpoint is a specific URL that represents a resource or service, responds to these methods differently, and requires distinct testing approaches. For instance, testing a GET endpoint might focus on verifying correct data retrieval with various query parameters, while testing a POST endpoint would validate proper data creation with different payloads. Security adds layers of complexity to API testing. Authentication mechanisms like JSON Web Tokens (JWT) require tests to include proper authorization headers. Security testing also should validate protection against common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, CSRF attacks, and cross-site scripting. 

## Reflection

This course has significantly advanced my professional goals by deepening my understanding of modern full-stack development practices. Despite my prior experience in this field, the curriculum challenged me to critically evaluate architectural decisions rather than applying one-size-fits-all solutions. Most notably, I gained valuable perspective on the nuanced trade-offs between different frontend approaches. I discovered that while single-page applications (SPAs) offer impressive user experiences through fluid interactions, they aren't always the optimal choice for every project scenario. This newfound perspective represents a significant professional maturation, equipping me to make more balanced architectural decisions that consider business requirements, technical constraints, and long-term maintainability. Moving forward, I'm confident that this more nuanced understanding of full-stack development options will enable me to deliver solutions that are not just technically sound but strategically aligned with project goals, which is a valuable skill set that substantially enhances my marketability in today's diverse development landscape.
